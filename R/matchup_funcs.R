# This is a file where we are planning to add multiple functions for extracting matchups easily.
# Plan include:
# Extract from pixel box of n*m size
# Need to decide on input data formats - accept data frame (columns x, y, z), or matrix, etc.?
# Also don't need to duplicate functionality that is already in raster() package
