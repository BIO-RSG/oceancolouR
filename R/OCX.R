#' Color Index Algorithm
#'
#' Given blue, green, and red Rrs (remote sensing reflectances), calculate the color index used in Hu et al (2012).
#'
#' The blue, green, and red wavebands are 443, 555, and 670, respectively. See ?hu or the example below for details about using sensors with other wavebands.

#' @param rrs_blue Numeric vector of remote sensing reflectances (Rrs) from the "blue" waveband

#' Hu chlorophyll-a algorithm
#'
#' Given a set of Rrs, and corresponding wavebands and coefficients, calculate chlorophyll using the Hu algorithm:
#'
#' 10^(a + b*CI), where CI is the color index calculated by ci()
#'
#' (similar to the OCx algorithm, but using CI instead of a band ratio, and a first degree polynomial instead of a 3rd or 4th degree.)
#'
#' The coefficients are not sensor-specific, but there are two different versions (first calculated in Hu et al 2012, later optimized in 2019).
#'
#' This uses the SeaWiFS bands centered at 443, 555, and 670nm. For sensors with other wavebands, it uses the band closest to those (note that for MODIS, the closest "ocean" band is 547nm, not 555nm, which is for land). The difference in Rrs in the "green" band can be noticeable with a shift in wavelength, so if the sensor does not use the 555nm band, conv_rrs_to_555() is used to convert the Rrs at the green wavelength to Rrs at 555nm. This is not done with the red band because the difference in Rrs in that area of the spectrum is not as noticeable with a small shift in wavelength.
#'
#' @param rrs Numeric matrix where rows = records, columns = Rrs wavebands, with named columns ("Rrs_XXX", where XXX is a wavelength in nanometres, ordered from blue to green to red).
#' @param wave Numeric vector of Rrs wavebands matching those used in the column name(s) of rrs, arranged from shortest waveband to longest (example: c(443, 555, 670)).
#' @param coefs Numeric vector of coefficients corresponding to terms in the polynomial (lowest degree to highest). See ?get_ci_coefs

#' OCX algorithm
#'
#' Given a set of Rrs and coefficients, calculate chlorophyll using a polynomial band ratio algorithm. See ?optimize_ocx_coefs for example.
#'
#' This is the algorithm used by NASA (as of Nov 2020). It is replaced with the Hu algorithm (see ?hu) for Hu chla concentrations < 0.15 mg /m^3, and a blend of Hu and OCx for Hu concentrations between 0.15 and 0.2.
#'
#' @param rrs Either: Numeric matrix where rows = records, columns = Rrs wavebands, with named columns ("Rrs_XXX", where XXX is a wavelength in nanometres), OR: RasterStack of rrs layers with stack layers following the same naming convention. Names must match c(blues, green), i.e. same names, from shortest waveband to longest.
#' @param blues Character vector of Rrs wavebands in the blue range (e.g. c("Rrs_443", Rrs_488")), matching column name(s) in rrs, maximum 3 options, arranged from shortest waveband to longest. Note that if use_443nm=FALSE, the 443nm waveband will be removed and another must be used in its place.
#' @param green String, Rrs waveband in the green range (e.g. "Rrs_547"), matching a column name in rrs
#' @param coefs Numeric vector of coefficients corresponding to terms in the polynomial (lowest degree to highest)
#' @param use_443nm Logical value, TRUE to make the 443nm band an option in the band ratio
#' @param use_CI Logical value, use the color index algorithm from Hu et al (2012) and the blending boundaries used in the NASA OCx algorithm? (see details)
#' @param sensor String, either modis, seawifs, or viirs (only necessary if using CI so the wavebands can be determined, also note that "modis" is MODIS-Aqua, and "viirs" is VIIRS-SNPP)
#' @param CI_coef_version Numeric value, 1 or 2 only. Version of coefficients to use for the Hu algorithm (version 1 = 2012 paper, version 2 = 2019 paper). See ?ocx or ?hu for details.
#' @param CI_bound1 Numeric value, the lower value where blending between OCI and OCX should begin
#' @param CI_bound2 Numeric value, the higher value where blending between OCI and OCX should end
