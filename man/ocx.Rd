\title{OCX algorithm}
\usage{
ocx(rrs, blues, green, coefs, use_443nm)
}
\arguments{
\item{rrs}{Numeric matrix where rows = records, columns = Rrs wavebands, with named columns ("Rrs_XXX", where XXX is a wavelength in nanometres)}

\item{blues}{Character vector of Rrs wavebands in the blue range (e.g. "Rrs_488"), matching column name(s) in rrs, maximum 3 options}

\item{green}{String, Rrs waveband in the green range (e.g. "Rrs_547"), matching a column name in rrs}

\item{coefs}{Numeric vector of coefficients corresponding to terms in the polynomial (lowest degree to highest)}

\item{use_443nm}{Logical value, TRUE to make the 443nm band an option in the band ratio}
}
\value{
Numeric value (or vector), chlorophyll as computed by OCX for the given Rrs, sensor, and coefficients.
}
\description{
Given a set of coefficients, calculate chlorophyll using a polynomial band ratio algorithm. See ?optimize_ocx_coefs for example.
